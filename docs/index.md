# AI From Scratch

Welcome! I'm **Amit**, and I built this site as a personal project to deeply understand Machine Learning and Deep Learning by **implementing core algorithms entirely from scratch**.

This space is meant to be a hands-on companion for anyone exploring ML/DL fundamentals. Whether you're revising concepts, learning how things work under the hood, or building your own implementations, I hope you find these resources valuable.

## Key Sections
- **Projects**  
  Explore step-by-step implementations of ML/DL algorithms from scratch.
- **Roadmap** 
  A structured learning path designed for beginners and self-learners.
