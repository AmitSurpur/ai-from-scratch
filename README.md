# AI From Scratch

Learning and implementing machine learning and deep learning from first principles

This project is my starting point for implementing AI from the very basics.
I am learning every concept step by step, and building each algorithm from scratch, without relying on high-level ML libraries.
The goal is to understand how things truly work
